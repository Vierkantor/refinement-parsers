	abstract="In this paper, I show that general recursive definitions can be represented in the free monad which supports the `effect' of making a recursive call, without saying how these calls should be executed. Diverse semantics can be given within a total framework by suitable monad morphisms. The Bove-Capretta construction of the domain of a general recursive function can be presented datatype-generically as an instance of this technique. The paper is literate Agda, but its key ideas are more broadly transferable.",
